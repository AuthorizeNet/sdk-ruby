    # Constructs a Reporting transaction. You can use the new Reporting transaction object
    # to issue a request to the payment gateway and parse the response into a new
    # AuthorizeNet::Reporting::Response object.
    #
    # +api_login_id+:: Your API login ID, as a string.
    # +api_transaction_key+:: Your API transaction key, as a string.
    # +options+:: A hash of options. See below for values.
    #
    # Options
    # +gateway+:: The gateway to submit the transaction to. Can be a URL string, an AuthorizeNet::Reporting::Transaction::Gateway constant, or one of the convenience symbols :sandbox, :test, :production, or :live (:test is an alias for :sandbox, and :live is an alias for :production).
    # +verify_ssl+:: A boolean indicating if the SSL certificate of the +gateway+ should be verified. Defaults to true.
    # +reference_id+:: A string that can be used to identify a particular transaction with its response. Will be echo'd in the response, only if it was provided in the transaction. Defaults to nil.

    # run, this method will return nil. Otherwise it will return an AuthorizeNet::Reporting::Response object. The
    # response object will have an array of Batch objects available via its batch_list method if
    # the request was successful.
    #
    #
    # +from_date+:: Takes either a DateTime or a String representing a date and time. Only settled batches >= this value will be returned. Defaults to nil (which returns >= 24hrs ago). A to_date must be specified if a from_date is.
    # +to_date+:: Takes either a DateTime or a String representing a date and time. Only settled batches <= this value will be returned. Defaults to nil. The maximum date range is 31 days, and a from_date must be supplied if a to_date is.
    # +include_stats+:: Takes a Boolean. Determines if BatchStatistics should be returned with the Batch objects. Defaults to false.
