    # Constructs a SIM transaction. You can use the new SIM transaction object
    # to build the hidden field payload needed to process a SIM transaction with
    # the gateway. In particular, this class handles generating the MD5 fingerprint
    # used to authenticate transactions at the gateway. Since the fingerprint includes
    # the amount to charge, you should not construct this object until you know EXACTLY
    # how much you want to charge (or authorize).
    # 
    # +api_login_id+:: Your API login ID, as a string.
    # +api_transaction_key+:: Your API transaction key, as a string.
    # +amount+:: The amount of the transaction, as a string, Float or BigDecimal.
    # +options+:: A hash of options. See below for values.
    # 
    # Options
    # +sequence+:: The sequence number of the transaction as a string or Integer. This is usually something like an invoice number. If none is provided, the SDK generates one at random.
    # +timestamp+:: The time the transaction was initiated as a string or Integer. This needs to be within 15 minutes of when the gateway receives the transaction. If no value is provided, the SDK defaults it to Time.now().
    # +test+:: A boolean indicating if the transaction should be run in test mode or not (defaults to false).
    # +hosted_payment_form+:: A boolean indicating if the transaction should use a hosted payment form (defaults to false).
    # +relay_response+:: A boolean indicating if the transaction should use the relay response feature to return a receipt to the customer (defaults to true). Direct Post Method requires using a relay response.
    # +relay_url+:: A string of the URL that the gateway should hit to get the relay response (defaults to nil).
    # +transaction_type+:: The type of transaction to perform. Defaults to AuthorizeNet::Type::AUTHORIZE_AND_CAPTURE. This value is only used if run is called directly.
